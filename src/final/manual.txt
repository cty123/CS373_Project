1. All codes are written in python, therefore there's no need for compilation. 
However, before running the python codes, make sure you have the following libraries installed
    * numpy
    * pandas
    * matplotlib
    * sklearn
    * scipy
    
2. Datasets folder contains the original data AND the processed data with our selected features only, the 
source code will use the dataset inside /sources directory to execute(rather than using the dataset in /dataset directory)

3. To run our code, use the terminal, navigate to /sources directory. Make sure you performed Step 1. 
Run command:

python3 P1_Load_Data.py 
python3 P3_Analyzing_Data.py
python3 P4_Training
python3 P5_Cross_Validation
python3 P6_Hyperparameter_tuning
python3 P7_Discussion

These commands will lead you to perform the step by step execution exactly like our report document. 

# NOTE: Because we randomly shuffle the whole dataset before performing linear regression, the result you have for 
cross validation and hyperparameter tuning could be different than our results in the report document.
