1. All codes are written in python, therefore there's no need for compilation. 
However, before running the python codes, make sure you have the following libraries installed
    * numpy
    * pandas
    * matplotlib
    * sklearn

2. Datasets folder contains the original data AND the processed data with our selected features only, the 
source code will use the dataset inside /source directory to execute(rather than using the dataset in /dataset directory)
